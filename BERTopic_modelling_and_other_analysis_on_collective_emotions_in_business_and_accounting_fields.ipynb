This study explores screen and digital ambivalence in nature-based tourism in and around the huts and routes of the Norwegian Trekking Association. While digital ambivalence describes ambiguous sentiments over being constantly connected, screen ambivalence covers mixed feelings regarding the presence of smartphones and screens. Methodologically, this qualitative study combined observations at 3 offline sites with an analysis of 30 field dialogues. The study found that hikers were highly aware of the positive and negative functions of digital media. Offline tourism may intensify the experience of taking a break, realising what tourists perceive to be the true nature of friluftsliv [outdoor life], heighten the sense of adventure and self-reliance. However, tensions concerning safety, missing social communication, and obstacles to posting on social media were also evident. This study contributes to the limited research on digital disconnection and offers new insights into the experiential qualities of offline holidays. Few studies have mapped tourist experiences in specific offline sites, and this study contributes to nature-based tourism research by showing how local norms mitigate tensions and nudge hikers towards positive interpretations of being digital-free. \\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

However, many products or services now have a large number of online reviews, which makes it difficult for consumers to decide which reviews to pay attention to or for businesses to identify which critical areas to improve on. The use of text mining and sentiment mining techniques is deemed important to automatically process the content of online reviews and help improve review usefulness. Applying a four-phase research model, the authors performed topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract five topics (price, time, food, service, and location) and sentiment analysis using Python TextBlob to aggregate consumer sentiment per topic from a Yelp restaurant reviews dataset. The authors propose that the design of recommender systems for OCRs or business decision-making systems can be faster, simpler, and more useful by integrating automatic topics extraction and sentiment analysis.

The existing literature squarely places remote working as an antecedent to employee perceptions of Organizational Justice throughout many industries. The same literature presents work from home in a positive frame of reference in a pre-pandemic world. However, in the Covid-19 environment, many perceptions have changed regarding employment. Likely overall perceptions regarding work from home have also shifted because more people engage in the activity. We argue that perceptions of work from home through the frame of reference found in the literature of Organizational Justice have shifted to be more negative. To study this phenomenon, we gathered social media data in comments from a work discussion forum on the Reddit website. We coded the data with an a priori codeset and assigned dummy variables for analysis. The dataset was analyzed via a five-way Factorial ANOVA examining the influences of the four independent variables of Organizational Justice (Distributive, Procedural, Interpersonal, and Informational Justice) and the temporal occurrence of Covid-19 on the sentimental polarity of comments surrounding the topic of work from home. Our findings indicated that Informational Justice significantly contributes to more negative sentiment regarding work-from-home. Additionally, when Distributive, Interpersonal, and Informational Justice and Distributive and Informational Justice interact, sentimental polarity grows more negative for work from home.

In this paper, we examined the importance of detecting fake news and incorporated sentiment and emotional features to detect this type of news. Specifically, we compared the sentiments and emotions associated with fake and real news using a COVID-19 Twitter dataset with labeled categories. By utilizing different sentiment and emotion lexicons, we extracted sentiments categorized as positive, negative, and neutral and eight basic emotions, anticipation, anger, joy, sadness, surprise, fear, trust, and disgust. Our analysis revealed that fake news tends to elicit more negative emotions than real news. Therefore, we propose that negative emotions could serve as vital features in developing fake news detection models. To test this hypothesis, we compared the performance metrics of three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and Na\\u00efve Bayes. We evaluated the models\\u2019 effectiveness with and without emotional features. Our results demonstrated that integrating emotional features into these models substantially improved the detection performance, resulting in a more robust and reliable ability to detect fake news on social media. In this paper, we propose the use of novel features and methods that enhance the field of fake news detection. Our findings underscore the crucial role of emotions in detecting fake news and provide valuable insights into how machine-learning models can be trained to recognize these features. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.\",\n          \"The quality of logistics services affects the performance and competitiveness of express logistics companies. Conventional evaluation methods of service quality are based on constructing a rating index system and then comprehensively evaluating the associated questionnaires and interviews. Such methods are often subjective, time-consuming, and include a limited sample size (data). On the other hand, customers' opinions concerning logistics services can now be deciphered using online customer reviews. Therefore, this study proposes a method combining the models of latent Dirichlet allocation and long-short term memory (LDA-LSTM) to overcome the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. The main contributions include four aspects. First, the LDA-LSTM model can extract comprehensive aspects and opinions to develop evaluation indexes and scores for logistics service quality, and the reviews of a logistics firm can be examined to verify the effectiveness of this method. Second, the LDA-LSTM model can handle a situation in which several aspects and opinions express one topic or sentiment, and it outperforms the joint sentiment topic model (JST) and naive Bayes classification (NB). Third, positive and negative ratings can reflect a firm's overall service quality, with an excellent rating highlighting the best service quality, which can provide a multi-dimensional evaluation. Fourth, we also identify the indicators of logistics service quality on which customers focus, and we compare the service quality among express enterprises in China. \\u00a9 2024 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.\",\n          \"Analyzing 48 foreign exchange (FX) rates and 1.2 million FX-related news articles over a 35-year period, using digital textual analysis, we find that a currency reversal investment strategy that buys (sells) currencies with low (high) media sentiment offers strong positive and statistically significant returns and Sharpe ratios. The results are robust and the strategy adds value over other currency premia determinants. Analysts' forecasts systematically mispredict the reversal strategy.

In this paper, we examined the importance of detecting fake news and incorporated sentiment and emotional features to detect this type of news. Specifically, we compared the sentiments and emotions associated with fake and real news using a COVID-19 Twitter dataset with labeled categories. By utilizing different sentiment and emotion lexicons, we extracted sentiments categorized as positive, negative, and neutral and eight basic emotions, anticipation, anger, joy, sadness, surprise, fear, trust, and disgust. Our analysis revealed that fake news tends to elicit more negative emotions than real news. Therefore, we propose that negative emotions could serve as vital features in developing fake news detection models. To test this hypothesis, we compared the performance metrics of three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and Na\\u00efve Bayes. We evaluated the models\\u2019 effectiveness with and without emotional features. Our results demonstrated that integrating emotional features into these models substantially improved the detection performance, resulting in a more robust and reliable ability to detect fake news on social media. In this paper, we propose the use of novel features and methods that enhance the field of fake news detection. Our findings underscore the crucial role of emotions in detecting fake news and provide valuable insights into how machine-learning models can be trained to recognize these features. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.\",\n          \"The quality of logistics services affects the performance and competitiveness of express logistics companies. Conventional evaluation methods of service quality are based on constructing a rating index system and then comprehensively evaluating the associated questionnaires and interviews. Such methods are often subjective, time-consuming, and include a limited sample size (data). On the other hand, customers' opinions concerning logistics services can now be deciphered using online customer reviews. Therefore, this study proposes a method combining the models of latent Dirichlet allocation and long-short term memory (LDA-LSTM) to overcome the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. The main contributions include four aspects. First, the LDA-LSTM model can extract comprehensive aspects and opinions to develop evaluation indexes and scores for logistics service quality, and the reviews of a logistics firm can be examined to verify the effectiveness of this method. Second, the LDA-LSTM model can handle a situation in which several aspects and opinions express one topic or sentiment, and it outperforms the joint sentiment topic model (JST) and naive Bayes classification (NB). Third, positive and negative ratings can reflect a firm's overall service quality, with an excellent rating highlighting the best service quality, which can provide a multi-dimensional evaluation. Fourth, we also identify the indicators of logistics service quality on which customers focus, and we compare the service quality among express enterprises in China. \\u00a9 2024 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.\",\n          \"Analyzing 48 foreign exchange (FX) rates and 1.2 million FX-related news articles over a 35-year period, using digital textual analysis, we find that a currency reversal investment strategy that buys (sells) currencies with low (high) media sentiment offers strong positive and statistically significant returns and Sharpe ratios. The results are robust and the strategy adds value over other currency premia determinants. Analysts' forecasts systematically mispredict the reversal strategy. This is the first article to show that price reversals based on media sentiment are a well-defined feature of the FX market.  \\u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

        "Agglomerative vs. Divisive:\n",
        "\n",
        "Agglomerative: Starts with each observation as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters. This is the most common approach.\n",
        "Divisive: Starts with all observations in one cluster and iteratively splits the clusters.\n",
        "Distance Metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) affects how clusters are formed. The distance metric measures the dissimilarity between data points.\n",
        "Linkage Criteria:\n",
        "\n",
        "Single Linkage: Distance between the closest points of the clusters.\n",
        "Complete Linkage: Distance between the farthest points of the clusters.\n",
        "Average Linkage: Average distance between all points of the clusters.\n",
        "Ward’s Method: Minimizes the variance within each cluster.\n",
        "Dendrogram:\n",
        "\n",
        "A tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits. The vertical axis represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters.\n",
        "Interpretation of Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
        "Dendrogram Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Height of Branches: The vertical height at which two clusters merge indicates the distance or dissimilarity between them. Taller branches imply greater dissimilarity.\n",
        "Cluster Formation: By cutting the dendrogram at a certain height, you can determine the number of clusters. The horizontal line at the cut point intersects the dendrogram, defining the clusters.\n",
        "Cluster Similarity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Clusters that merge at lower heights are more similar to each other compared to those merging at higher heights.\n",
        "Sub-clusters:\n",

        "Hierarchical Clustering in Topic Modeling:\n",
        "In the context of topic modeling using BERTopic, hierarchical clustering helps visualize the relationships and similarities between topics. Topics that are closely related (in terms of their word distributions) will be merged first, while more distinct topics merge later."
